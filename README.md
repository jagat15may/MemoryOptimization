# Memory Optimization
Memory Optimization is achieved using several Techniques while staying within cost and power budget. 
Each technique is either neutral, positve or ngetive impact on Cost/ power/ Accesstime and bandwidth.
Perfomance quantity is defined as combination of access-time and bandwidth. 
Depending on the class of computer each kind of system has different budget for cost/ power and expectation of the performance. 
The python program here will allow you to pick the system of your choice from ( PMDs/ Desktop/ Server/ Warehouse scale/ Embeded) and 
give you a minimum target of Performce you have to reach while staying within the budget for cost and Power.
You can choose upto 3 basic (out of 6) and upto 3 advance technique (out of 10) and achive the minimum performance target while 
not going negetive on your cost and power budget. The More performance you can achieve the better while staying still within cost and power budget.

Budget for Cost and Power and Performance expectation is here for each class of system

Here is the table that indicates the impact of each technique for each category of property related to computer.
